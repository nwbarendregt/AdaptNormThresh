# AdaptNormThresh

This is a repository for all code and data used in N.W. Barendregt et al., `Normative Decision Rules in Changing Environments' (2022). 
Each folder is labeled by the figure number as given by the manuscript. Contained in each folder is a script named "Figure_X_Generate.m". Running this script will generate the corresponding figure of the paper. Code used to generate any necessary supplemental figures are listed in the folder associated with supplemental figures's main figure (e.g., code used to generate Figure 2 -- Supplemental Figure 1 will be in the Figure 2 folder).
All necessary data files are included, as well as the individual scripts and functions used to generate the data. We would like to thank Paul Cisek for providing subject data from the tokens task.
